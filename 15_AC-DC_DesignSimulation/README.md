----------

This project contains a design for a simple Alternating Current (AC) to Direct Current (DC) converter.

## Files

The main file in this project is:

- `Crosquis_Salida_Conversor_simple_AC_DC.slx`: This file contains the design of the AC to DC converter.

## AC to DC Converter

An AC to DC converter is a device that converts Alternating Current (AC), which periodically changes direction, into Direct Current (DC), which flows constantly in one direction.

## How to Use

1. Open the `Crosquis_Salida_Conversor_simple_AC_DC.slx` file in MATLAB Simulink.
2. Analyze the design to understand how an AC to DC converter works.
